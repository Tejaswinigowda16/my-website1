<h1>The Clever Crow</h1>
<pre>On a <b>hot summer</b> day, a <i>thirsty crow</i> flew across fields looking for water(H<sub>2</sub>O). 
After a long <small>search</small>, it found a pitcher with very little water at the bottom. 
The <strong>crow</strong> tried to <em>drink</em>, but its <ins>beak</ins> <del>couldnâ€™t</del> reach the water.

It looked around and saw some <q>small pebbles</q> on the ground. 
One by one, the crow picked them up and dropped them into the pitcher. 
Slowly, the water level rose. Finally, the crow was able to drink the water and flew away happily &#128512.</pre>
